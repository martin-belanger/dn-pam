Commit log requirements
=======================
Each commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the second
line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually ChangeLog-style
entries for all affected files, except the leading TABs which should
be omitted.  It's OK to write a few lines of prose describing the change,
when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of the big picture.
